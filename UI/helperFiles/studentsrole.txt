As learners, students play a crucial and active role in education. They involve and interact with students and teachers, participate in classroom discussions, and act in a receptive manner. With changing times, the role of learners in education has got subverted from a facilitator to a task monitor. They collect materials for learning and assignments, check on their study times, put back materials at their respective places after using them, and more. Developing excellent communication skills, being friendly and polite, and making practical applications of what they learn are some of the major roles that students play as learners in education.
