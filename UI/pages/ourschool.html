                <h2>How the school was started</h2>
                <p>
                    The idea of ​​opening a school was born in 1997 to meet the needs of parents who wanted their children to take lessons in French and later in English; at the time, establishments that could respond were limited or overcrowded. Moreover, parents in Kigali do not have time to follow their children's study and homework at home following their occupations. It is within this framework that we created a school responding to this urgent and priority concern of children's education.                </p>

                <p>
                    There is no denying how significant a school is in shaping up a student’s personality and holistic learning process. Like an experienced teacher and teaching pedagogy play a critical role in shaping students’ academic lives, infrastructure is also vital. It creates a favourable environment for students’ holistic development. It’s a common knowledge that every parent wants to spend money where their kids feel safe and secure while learning and enjoying their student life. They wish to ensure the schools have ample safety standards and facilities to make learning a joy.<br><br>
                    There are studies suggesting students in schools with poor infrastructure can have lower scores than those with access to better infrastructure facilities. This makes school infrastructure a key element in a child’s academic as well as holistic growth.<br><br>
                                    
                    Besides, an overcrowded classroom and stressful environment also affect students’ learning capabilities. That’s why school-teacher ratio is also a key parameter for parents before they admit their wards to any specific school.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>What Comprises School Infrastructure?</b><br><br>
                    
                    Some of the key components which should feature in an ideal checklist while assessing any school infrastructure are as follows:
                  
                    Spacious and well- ventilated classrooms<br><br>
                   <i> Libraries<br></i>
                    <i>Playgrounds</i><br>
                    <i>Well-equipped labs</i><br>
                    <i>Facilities study tables, chairs, furniture and basic utilities such as water, electricity etc.</i><br>
                    <i>Study halls</i><br>
                    <i>Games equipment</i><br>
                    <i>Assembly area</i><br>
                    <i>Well-maintained sanitation facilities</i><br>
                   <br>
                    <b>Infrastructure Essentials for Schools</b><br><br>
Besides basic amenities, here are a few important components that schools across India are trying to provide:<br><br>
<b>Libraries</b><br>
A well-equipped library housing a wealth of useful books or informative and interesting video facilities, coupled with a motivating or mood-lifting ambiance not only attracts students but also develops a liking to study. It encourages exploring interesting things among students, especially in their formative years when the curiosity to know is intense among curious minds of children. Such places also serve as holding interactive sessions and exchanging knowledge among students, thereby enhancing students’ writing and reading skills.<br><br>

<b>Sports Facilities</b><br><br>
A school without having a scope to play and develop sporting skills can make or mar a school’s reputation in modern times. For, every child today views some or the other sports personality as his/ her ideal. Be it martial arts, swimming, cricket or skating, students wish to learn something at school itself to be better than their friends in the neighbourhood. Thus, availability of sports facilities, basketball courts, tennis courts, cricket pitch, skating rink, volleyball courts and an indoor gym are currently considered to be essential parts of any modern-day School’s infrastructure.
<br><br>
<b>ICT Labs/Multimedia Centre</b><br>
    State-of-the-art ICT laboratories/multimedia labs can play an enabling role in harnessing the use of technology for improving the learning outcomes for students. These also serve to create opportunities for latest styles of learning, and ways to create and collaborate on cutting-edge IT-backed paradigms.
    <br><br><b>Interactive Projector Room</b><br>
    The interactive projector, which is a portable solution, helps to convert any surface (existing projector screens, whiteboards, or wall surface) into an interactive surface. Along with it, an interactive pen which can be used to draw, point or click just by touching the screen directly is now becoming popular in many schools across the country.
    <br><br><b>Online learning Portal</b><br>  
    The aim of this online learning portal is to enable the teachers to distribute learning materials to the students even in remote areas. This helps much especially for periods in which students are not requested to come to school<br>Each class has a class code and it is used by the students to enter the system.<br>Teachers have also access to this platform where they login with their email and password and use the system to upload learning n=materials for the students to access them
