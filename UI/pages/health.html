                <h2>School Prevention Measures for COVID-19</h2>
                <p>
                    There are several actions and requirements that should be reviewed and put in place to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in schools and into the community; and to ensure the safety of children and school staff while at school. Special provisions should be considered for early childhood development, higher learning institutions, residential schools or specialized institutions.

                    <br><br><b>Community-level measures</b>:Carry out early detection, testing, contact tracing and quarantine of contacts; investigate clusters; ensure physical distancing, hand and hygiene practices and age-appropriate mask use; shield vulnerable groups. Community-led initiatives such as addressing misleading rumors also play an important role in reducing the risk of infection.

                    <br><br><b>Policy, practice and infrastructure</b>: Ensure the necessary resources, policies and infrastructure, are in place that protect the health and safety of all school personnel, including people at higher risk.

Behavioral aspects: Consider the age and capacity of students to understand and respect measures put in place. Younger children may find it more difficult to adhere to physical distancing or the appropriate use of masks.

<br><br><b>Safety and security:</b> School closure or re-opening may affect the safety and security of students and the most vulnerable children may require special attention, such as during pick-up and drop-off.

<br><br><b>Hygiene and daily practices at the school and classroom level: </b>Physical distancing of at least 1 metre between individuals including spacing of desks, frequent hand and respiratory hygiene, age-appropriate mask use, ventilation and environmental cleaning measures should be in place to limit exposure. Schools should educate staff and students on COVID-19 prevention measures, develop a schedule for daily cleaning and disinfection of the school environment, facilities and frequently touches surfaces, and ensure availability of hand hygiene facilities and national/local guidance on the use of masks.

<br><br><b>Screening and care of sick students, teachers and other school staff:</b> Schools should enforce the policy of “staying home if unwell”, waive the requirement for a doctor’s note, create a checklist for parents/students/staff to decide whether to go to school (taking into consideration the local situation), ensure students who have been in contact with a COVID-19 case stay home for 14 days, and consider options for screening on arrival.

<br><br><b>Protection of individuals at high-risk:</b> Schools should identify students and teachers at high-risk with pre-existing medical conditions to come up with strategies to keep them safe; maintain physical distancing and se of medical masks as well as frequent hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.

<br><br><b>Communication with parents and students:</b> Schools should keep students and parents informed about the measures being implemented to ensure their collaboration and support.

<br><br><b>Additional school-related measures such as immunization checks and catch-up vaccination programmes:</b> Ensure continuity or expansion of essential services, including school feeding and mental health and psycho-social support.

<br><br><b>Physical distancing outside classrooms:</b> Maintain a distance of at least 1 metre for both students (all age groups) and staff, where feasible.

<br><br><b>Physical distancing inside classrooms:</b>

In areas with community transmission of COVID-19, maintain a distance of at least 1 metre between all individuals of all age groups, for any schools remaining open. This includes increasing desk spacing and staging recesses, breaks and lunchbreaks; limiting the mixing of classes and of age groups; considering smaller classes or alternating attendance schedules, and ensuring good ventilation in classrooms.

                <h2>Infrastructure facilities</h2>
                <p>

                    There is no denying how significant a school is in shaping up a student’s personality and holistic learning process. Like an experienced teacher and teaching pedagogy play a critical role in shaping students’ academic lives, infrastructure is also vital. It creates a favourable environment for students’ holistic development. It’s a common knowledge that every parent wants to spend money where their kids feel safe and secure while learning and enjoying their student life. They wish to ensure the schools have ample safety standards and facilities to make learning a joy.<br><br>
                    There are studies suggesting students in schools with poor infrastructure can have lower scores than those with access to better infrastructure facilities. This makes school infrastructure a key element in a child’s academic as well as holistic growth.<br><br>
                                    
                    Besides, an overcrowded classroom and stressful environment also affect students’ learning capabilities. That’s why school-teacher ratio is also a key parameter for parents before they admit their wards to any specific school.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>What Comprises School Infrastructure?</b><br><br>
                    
                    Some of the key components which should feature in an ideal checklist while assessing any school infrastructure are as follows:
                  
                    Spacious and well- ventilated classrooms<br><br>
                   <i> Libraries<br></i>
                    <i>Playgrounds</i><br>
                    <i>Well-equipped labs</i><br>
                    <i>Facilities study tables, chairs, furniture and basic utilities such as water, electricity etc.</i><br>
                    <i>Study halls</i><br>
                    <i>Games equipment</i><br>
                    <i>Assembly area</i><br>
                    <i>Well-maintained sanitation facilities</i><br>
                   <br>
                    <b>Infrastructure Essentials for Schools</b><br><br>
Besides basic amenities, here are a few important components that schools across India are trying to provide:<br><br>
<b>Libraries</b><br>
A well-equipped library housing a wealth of useful books or informative and interesting video facilities, coupled with a motivating or mood-lifting ambiance not only attracts students but also develops a liking to study. It encourages exploring interesting things among students, especially in their formative years when the curiosity to know is intense among curious minds of children. Such places also serve as holding interactive sessions and exchanging knowledge among students, thereby enhancing students’ writing and reading skills.<br><br>

<b>Sports Facilities</b><br><br>
A school without having a scope to play and develop sporting skills can make or mar a school’s reputation in modern times. For, every child today views some or the other sports personality as his/ her ideal. Be it martial arts, swimming, cricket or skating, students wish to learn something at school itself to be better than their friends in the neighbourhood. Thus, availability of sports facilities, basketball courts, tennis courts, cricket pitch, skating rink, volleyball courts and an indoor gym are currently considered to be essential parts of any modern-day School’s infrastructure.
<br><br>
<b>ICT Labs/Multimedia Centre</b><br>
    State-of-the-art ICT laboratories/multimedia labs can play an enabling role in harnessing the use of technology for improving the learning outcomes for students. These also serve to create opportunities for latest styles of learning, and ways to create and collaborate on cutting-edge IT-backed paradigms.
    <br><br><b>Interactive Projector Room</b><br>
    The interactive projector, which is a portable solution, helps to convert any surface (existing projector screens, whiteboards, or wall surface) into an interactive surface. Along with it, an interactive pen which can be used to draw, point or click just by touching the screen directly is now becoming popular in many schools across the country.
    <br><br><b>Online learning Portal</b><br>  
    The aim of this online learning portal is to enable the teachers to distribute learning materials to the students even in remote areas. This helps much especially for periods in which students are not requested to come to school<br>Each class has a class code and it is used by the students to enter the system.<br>Teachers have also access to this platform where they login with their email and password and use the system to upload learning n=materials for the students to access them
